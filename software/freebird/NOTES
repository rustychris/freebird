GUI:
  compass calibration widget



A few times the serial connection has locked up - seems to have been because 
when not in sampling mode, pulse_count_start was not zeroed, so during
sample_setup it would start running the ISR too soon and get wedged.  Seems
like it should be able to handle that sort of thing, though maybe the buffer 
overrun situation is not working.
