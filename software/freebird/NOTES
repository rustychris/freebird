GUI:
  compass calibration widget



A few times the serial connection has locked up - seems to have been because 
when not in sampling mode, pulse_count_start was not zeroed, so during
sample_setup it would start running the ISR too soon and get wedged.  Seems
like it should be able to handle that sort of thing, though maybe the buffer 
overrun situation is not working.


No option to disconnect and discard a connected device panel.
Connecting to a second port draws on top of the first.

Does not deal well with a failed connection attempt, for example, if the
freebird is wedged.  It will set state to 'unknown', but no way for this
to be shown in the GUI.

Does not deal with missing calibration files.

GUI allows choosing a serial port, but it's not used in the
device.
