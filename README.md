freebird
========

A versatile, open source scientific data logger.

Basic design specs:
* 16-bit single channel ADC at 500SPS
* serial console for programming and diagnostics
* SD card storage
* accurate real time clock for timestamping data
* power draw <1.0w

The Freebird was first successfully deployed in the Connecticut River in May, 2014.
It has subsequently been deployed in the Columbia River and on a second cruise in
the Connecticut.  Full analyses of the data are still underway, but the 
dissipation values and structure of overturns appear reasonable and consistent
with other measurements in the same environments.
